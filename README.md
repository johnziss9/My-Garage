# My-Garage

I am creating a small car registration application in C# using WinForms for a small garage to use.

In the app the user will be able to register cars, customers and also there will be a car rental service to monitor which cars get rented and for how long.

The main objective of the app is to remind the user when a car needs a renewal or a service and also in the car rental service when should a car be returned and by who.

More features will follow.

In the future I am planning to turn this into a web application for more reliable access but for now it will just have to be installed on the user's personal machine.
